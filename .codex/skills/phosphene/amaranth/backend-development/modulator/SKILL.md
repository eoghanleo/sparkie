  short-description: Backend impl (stub)
---

## Domain

Primary domain: `<backend-development>`

## Status

Stub scaffold only (no instrument set yet).

## What you produce

- `backend-implementation` artifacts under `phosphene/domains/backend-development/output/` (and code changes elsewhere in the repo as required)

## How to work

- Implement `<api-design>` and `<database-design>` contracts faithfully.
- Prefer small vertical slices that can be verified by `<test-management>`.
- Until control scripts exist for this domain, direct code edits are allowed; keep diffs reviewable and avoid non-deterministic changes.

## Validation (stub)

- Validators and done-score scripts are not yet implemented for this domain.
