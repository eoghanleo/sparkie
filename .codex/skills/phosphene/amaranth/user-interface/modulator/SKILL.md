  short-description: UI specs (stub)
---

## Domain

Primary domain: `<user-interface>`

## Status

Stub scaffold only (no instrument set yet).

## What you produce

- `ui-spec` artifacts under `phosphene/domains/user-interface/output/`

## How to work

- Prefer upstream constraints from `<product-management>` and `<feature-management>` (acceptance criteria, edge cases).
- Keep outputs implementable: states, transitions, error messages, loading/empty cases.
- Until control scripts exist for this domain, **manual edits are allowed** for artifacts you add under the domain output folder.

## Validation (stub)

- Validators and done-score scripts are not yet implemented for this domain.
