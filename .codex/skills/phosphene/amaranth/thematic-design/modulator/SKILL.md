  short-description: Theme specs (stub)
---

## Domain

Primary domain: `<thematic-design>`

## Status

Stub scaffold only (no instrument set yet).

## What you produce

- `theme-spec` artifacts under `phosphene/domains/thematic-design/output/`

## How to work

- Treat this as “design system constraints that developers can implement,” not marketing visuals.
- Keep tokens stable; prefer deterministic naming; document accessibility constraints.
- Until control scripts exist for this domain, **manual edits are allowed** for artifacts you add under the domain output folder.

## Validation (stub)

- Validators and done-score scripts are not yet implemented for this domain.
