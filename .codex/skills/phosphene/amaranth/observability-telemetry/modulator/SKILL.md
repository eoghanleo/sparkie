## Domain

Primary domain: `<observability-telemetry>`

## Status

Stub scaffold only (no instrument set yet).

## What you produce

- `observability-spec` artifacts under `phosphene/domains/observability-telemetry/output/`

## How to work

- Prefer measurable commitments: SLOs, alert thresholds, dashboard panels, trace/log requirements.
- Keep operational intent explicit (what are we trying to detect; what action follows).
- Until control scripts exist for this domain, **manual edits are allowed** for artifacts you add under the domain output folder.

## Validation (stub)

- Validators and done-score scripts are not yet implemented for this domain.
