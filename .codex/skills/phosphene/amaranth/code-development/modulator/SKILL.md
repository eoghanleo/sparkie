## Domain

Primary domain: `<code-development>`

## Status

Stub scaffold only (no instrument set yet).

## What you produce

- `implementation` artifacts under `phosphene/domains/code-development/output/` (and code changes elsewhere in the repo as required)

## How to work

- Treat upstream artifacts as contracts: `<product-management>` specs, `<feature-management>` FRs, `<user-interface>` UI specs, `<api-design>` API specs, `<database-design>` db specs.
- Keep changes small and shippable; prefer deterministic, reviewable diffs.
- Until control scripts exist for this domain, direct code edits are allowed; keep a tight audit trail in commits/PRs.

## Validation (stub)

- Validators and done-score scripts are not yet implemented for this domain.
