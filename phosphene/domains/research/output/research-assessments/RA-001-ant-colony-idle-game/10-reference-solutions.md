## A) Reference solution scan (market + academic)

Checklist:
- Scan for similar ideas in-market (products, startups, OSS)
- Scan for similar ideas academically (papers, preprints, labs)
- Capture each as a ReferenceSolution with a stable ID + pointer
- Extract what to borrow vs avoid (patterns, claims, pitfalls)

## Reference solutions table

| RefSolID | Type (Market/Academic) | Name | 1–2 line summary | What to borrow | What to avoid | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RS-0001 | Market | Idle Ants (Madbox, 2021) | Hypercasual ant “idle” where ants devour objects; large mobile reach (10M+ downloads). | Simple viral loop; satisfying visuals; web portal distribution. | Shallow loop; ad-overload risk; low long-term depth. | `play.google.com` |
| RS-0002 | Market | Empires of the Undergrowth (Slug Disco, 2017–EA) | Premium PC ant colony RTS w/ species realism and strong reception. | Realism + production value matter; variety of ant species/behaviors. | High complexity barrier; premium fixed-content cadence. | `app.sensortower.com` |
| RS-0003 | Market | Swarm Simulator: Evolution (Scary Bee, 2019) | 3D remake of popular web incremental; F2P on Steam with IAP; “1M+ players” claim. | Deep incremental systems (prestige, resources); text-to-3D transition; long-tail retention. | QoL gated behind premium; onboarding/learning curve backlash. | `store.steampowered.com` |
| RS-0004 | Market | Idle Ant Colony (Bling Bling Games, 2020–2025) | Mobile idle tycoon about multiple colonies/maps; 500K+ downloads; active updates/community. | Multiple progression tracks (tech, expansion, prestige); live-ops cadence; community. | Mid/late pacing slowdown; onboarding overload; grind complaints. | `play.google.com` |
| RS-0005 | Academic | GPU Ant Colony Simulation (Dan Andersen, 2014) | GPU-based pheromone-following demo (WebGL-era) showing scale (1000s of ants). | Parallel simulation patterns (textures/state); scalability proof for emergent ant AI. | “Pure sim” lacks UX/game loop; performance traps in edge cases. | `github.com` |
| RS-0006 | Market | ChatGPT Apps SDK (OpenAI, 2025) | Platform to embed web apps in ChatGPT with conversational invocation; monetization infra planned. | Embedded UX + conversational control; leverage platform checkout once available. | Discovery/policy uncertainty; don’t bet whole product on channel. | `openai.com` |
