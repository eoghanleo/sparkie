This is an assembled view of the RA bundle. Use the component files for edits.


## Coversheet

ID: RA-001
Title: Monetizing Idle WebGPU Simulation Games (Ant Colony Case Study)
Status: Draft
Priority: Medium
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies: 
Owner: 

## Purpose + constraints (read first)

This document is a **web-research-only research assessment**. It is a cover letter that distills key findings and hypotheses for downstream work in `<product-marketing>`, `<product-strategy>`, and `<product-management>`.

Provenance note:
- The original deep-research narrative is preserved verbatim in `99-raw-agent-output.md` (it may contain an earlier internal RA ID; treat this bundle’s `ID: RA-001` as canonical).

Hard constraints for the research agent:
- No interviews; assume only public web sources.
- Primary outputs are reference solutions, competitive landscape, and candidate product pitches grounded in public evidence.
- Outputs are candidate segments/personas/pains/gains (theories) with evidence pointers and confidence grades.
- Product definition and scope should remain light; capture only what is necessary to frame pitches and hypotheses.

## Research coversheet (target: 1–2 pages)

### 1) Mission + deliverables + sprint success criteria

Mission:
- Enable a decision on whether to pursue a free-to-play, WebGPU-driven ant colony simulation game (with pseudo-idle mechanics) by providing evidence about monetization models, target audience hypotheses, competitive alternatives, and distribution options (including ChatGPT Apps).

Deliverables (expected):
- Reference solutions scan (market + academic) with stable IDs and pointers (RS-*)
- Competitive landscape summary (categories + key players + positioning)
- 3–5 candidate product pitches (PITCH-*) with EvidenceIDs + confidence
- Candidate segments (SEG-*) ranked, with rationale + out-of-scope list
- Candidate personas (PER-*) per top segment (hypotheses)
- Candidate jobs/pains/gains (IDs) per segment with severity/frequency (hypotheses)
- Evidence bank (EvidenceID + excerpt + pointer + strength/confidence)
- 5–15 key claims with confidence grades (what seems true from web sources)

Sprint success criteria:
- We understand how comparable idle/simulation titles monetize (ads + IAP tradeoffs) and have evidence-backed hypotheses for “what to build” and “who it’s for”.
- We have a small pitch set with clear “we lose when…” failure modes and a short list of next validation steps.

Downstream consumers & needs:
- `<product-marketing>`:
  - Needs: segments/personas + pitches + evidence for claims
- `<product-strategy>`:
  - Needs: competitive landscape + pitch set + key constraints/risks
- `<product-management>`:
  - Needs: top pitch(es) + evidence + assumptions/unknowns for validation

### 2) Scope, grounding, and what we don’t know

Minimal product grounding:
- Might be: a free-to-play web-based simulation game where players nurture an ant colony and watch emergent behaviors unfold with pseudo-idle progression.
- Likely isn’t: a premium RTS with heavy micromanagement, a narrative game, or a blockchain/Web3 product.

Scope boundaries:
- Industries: gaming (simulation + idle/incremental), web distribution, emerging “AI app” distribution (ChatGPT Apps).
- Geographies: global (sources skew to English-language web; treat as directional).
- Buyer types: end-consumer players (with parents as potential gatekeepers for minors / IAP).
- Explicit out-of-scope: B2B/institutional educational licensing; hardcore PvP/competitive esports; crypto/NFT play-to-earn.

Unknowns (not resolvable via web research):
- Willingness-to-play in ChatGPT (as a leisure channel) and actual discovery dynamics.
- Ant-sim retention/ARPDAU without prototype telemetry.
- WebGPU performance across typical devices (especially iOS constraints).

Assumptions made to proceed:
- Monetization patterns from mobile idle/simulation games can be adapted to web and/or ChatGPT contexts (ads may vary; IAP likely central).
- There is sufficient theme demand based on analogs (ant-themed idle games, ant PC sim success).

### 3) Top hypotheses snapshot (theories)

Top candidate segments (ranked):
- SEG-0001: Casual Idle Gamers
  - Wedge hypothesis: idle/mobile/web players drawn to low-effort progression and satisfying growth loops; ant theme provides novelty.
  - Top pains: P-0001 (ad/paywall pressure), P-0002 (pay-to-win/whale packs), P-0003 (complexity overload).
  - Top gains: G-0001 (offline progress), G-0002 (fair optional monetization), G-0003 (delightful theme/visuals).
  - Buying-center map: individual player (social proof via reviews/short-form video).
  - Triggers / why-now: idle remains popular; a “fresh” theme can stand out; instant web play reduces friction.

- SEG-0002: Simulation / Strategy Enthusiasts
  - Wedge hypothesis: sim/strategy players attracted to scientifically grounded emergent systems; will churn if it’s a shallow reskin.
  - Top pains: P-0004 (time investment barrier), P-0005 (F2P mechanics breaking realism), P-0006 (lack of authenticity/depth).
  - Top gains: G-0004 (believable ant behaviors), G-0005 (parameter/strategy control), G-0006 (accessible complexity).
  - Buying-center map: individual player; influenced by community reviews/forums.
  - Triggers / why-now: WebGPU enables complex in-browser sims; nature/sandbox interest; “no-install ant sim” novelty.

- SEG-0003: ChatGPT Power-Users / Edutainment Seekers
  - Wedge hypothesis: early adopters who spend time inside ChatGPT; want integrated entertainment/learning without context switching.
  - Top pains: P-0007 (ChatGPT entertainment staleness), P-0008 (context switching), P-0009 (trust/safety concerns).
  - Top gains: G-0007 (seamless in-chat launch), G-0008 (AI explanations), G-0009 (quick on-demand play).
  - Buying-center map: individual user + platform gatekeeping (OpenAI policy/review/discovery).
  - Triggers / why-now: ChatGPT Apps SDK launch + planned in-chat purchases (experimental channel).

### 4) Key findings (evidence-backed)

Include 5–15 claims. Each should cite EvidenceIDs.

- Claim 1: Idle simulation games can attract large player bases, indicating strong interest in the genre (including ant-themed variants).
  - Why it matters: de-risks “theme + genre” viability; suggests top-of-funnel acquisition potential.
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0002, E-0006
  - Confidence: C3
  - Notes: downloads ≠ retention; execution still dominates.

- Claim 2: Simulation/strategy games in the free-to-play market can monetize via IAP, not just ads, due to engagement depth.
  - Why it matters: supports a monetization plan that doesn’t rely on aggressive ad spam.
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0004, E-0006
  - Confidence: C2/C3
  - Notes: web contexts may differ; validate with prototype telemetry.

- Claim 3: Monetizing a browser-based game requires solving distribution at scale; without a platform you need either massive reach or a new channel.
  - Why it matters: forces an explicit distribution strategy (portals, app stores, ChatGPT Apps, etc.).
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0007
  - Confidence: C2/C3

- Claim 4: Idle game players are highly sensitive to monetization fairness; heavy pay-to-win or ad spam alienates them.
  - Why it matters: “fair monetization” is not a nice-to-have; it’s retention-critical.
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0001, E-0003, E-0004
  - Confidence: C3

- Claim 5: A realistic ant colony simulator with idle framing is niche-but-appealing; balancing casual delight and enthusiast depth is the core design risk.
  - Why it matters: informs pitch selection and scope control (easy to start, optional depth).
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0003, E-0005
  - Confidence: C2

- Claim 6: ChatGPT Apps are an experimental opportunity for game-like experiences with planned in-chat purchase infra, but adoption is unproven.
  - Why it matters: potential distribution wedge; treat as a high-upside experiment, not the only channel.
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0009, E-0010
  - Confidence: C1/C2

### 5) Candidate product pitches (stepping stones)

List the pitch set here (details live in `30-pitches/`):
- PITCH-0001: Ant Colony Idle Tycoon — Confidence: C2 — EvidenceIDs: E-0001, E-0002, E-0003, E-0005
- PITCH-0002: Ant Colony Tutor (ChatGPT Edition) — Confidence: C1/C2 — EvidenceIDs: E-0009, E-0010
- PITCH-0003: Sim Colony Builder (Series) — Confidence: C2 — EvidenceIDs: E-0002, E-0011, E-0012

### 6) Downstream handoff (do not finalize here)

What to do next (high level):
- `<product-marketing>` should turn pitches + hypotheses into personas/propositions and messaging tests.
- `<product-strategy>` should select a pitch (or reject) based on competition + constraints + risks.
- `<product-management>` should plan validation experiments for the chosen pitch and define a first spec slice.

## Pitches


### PITCH-0001

ID: PITCH-0001
Title: Ant Colony Idle Tycoon
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies:
Owner:

## One-line pitch

A free-to-play ant colony simulator that lets you grow and evolve a “living” ant empire in your browser — like SimCity for ants meets an idle game, where your colony progresses even when you’re away.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0001 (primary), SEG-0002 (secondary)
- Target candidate persona(s): CPE-0001 (primary), CPE-0002 (secondary)

## Trigger / why-now

- Casual: novelty + instant play (web/portal) is enough to try.
- Enthusiast: “real ant behavior” hook; “no-install ant sim” curiosity.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Pain: idle games become ad-spam / pay-to-win (P-0001/P-0002); sim fans churn on shallow reskins (P-0006).
- Gain: satisfying idle progression with **fair optional monetization** and enough emergent ant behavior to feel “real”.

## “So it works because…” (mechanism hypothesis)

- WebGPU enables large on-screen swarms and emergent behaviors (e.g., trails/roles).
- Idle loop delivers offline progress + short check-in sessions; optional depth exists for enthusiasts without blocking casual onboarding.

## Differentiation

- vs Idle Ants: deeper colony management + longer-term progression (not just a one-note gag).
- vs Idle Ant Colony: higher-fidelity sim feel + web-first (lower friction).
- vs Empires of the Undergrowth: free + quick-to-start idle cadence (not mission-based premium RTS).

## Likely objections + counters

- “Ants are gross / niche”: stylized/cute art direction; lean into wonder/curiosity.
- “Idle always turns greedy”: explicitly design for fairness; avoid hard stalls.

## EvidenceIDs

E-0001, E-0002, E-0003, E-0005

## Confidence

C2 — indicators suggest demand and monetization viability; execution risk is the main uncertainty.

## “We lose when…”

- Onboarding is too complex for SEG-0001, or too shallow for SEG-0002.
- Monetization feels coercive (paywalls/ad spam).
- Distribution is unsolved (no reach).

## Unknowns to validate next

- Balance point between idle automation and interactive agency.
- Whether “realism” materially increases retention.
- Device performance and WebGPU availability constraints.

RA: RA-001
Title: Ant Colony Idle Tycoon
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Confidence: C2
EvidenceIDs: E-0001, E-0002, E-0003, E-0005

## One-line pitch

A free-to-play ant colony simulator that lets you grow and evolve a realistic ant empire in your browser — “SimCity for ants meets idle,” where your colony runs even when you’re away.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0001 (primary), SEG-0002 (secondary)
- Target candidate persona(s): CPE-0001 (“Idle Ingrid”), CPE-0002 (“Strategic Sam”)

## Trigger / why-now

- Novel theme in saturated idle market; frictionless access via web.
- Enthusiast hook: “real ant behavior” and visible emergent systems.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Pain: idle fatigue + coercive monetization (P-0001, P-0002)
- Gain: satisfying growth loop + fair monetization + visual delight (G-0001, G-0002, G-0003)
- Pain: “ant sim is just a skin” disappointment (P-0006)
- Gain: believable colony behavior (G-0004)

## So it works because… (mechanism, not scope)

- WebGPU enables many visible agents; the “wow” is watching emergent colony behaviors.
- Idle progression is layered with meaningful inflection decisions (upgrades/expansions) instead of constant chores.

## Differentiation vs reference solutions

- Deeper/less one-note than hypercasual ant idles (RS-0001).
- More accessible/faster to try than premium PC sims (RS-0002).
- Web-first, with optional “chat wrapper” as an acquisition channel (RS-0006).

## Likely objections + counters

- “Ants are gross / too niche.” → stylized presentation; nature-curiosity framing; optional educational angle.
- “Idle games become pay-to-win.” → fairness stance; avoid hard paywalls; monetize via QoL/cosmetics.

## We lose when…

- Onboarding is too complex for casuals or sim depth is too shallow for enthusiasts.
- Monetization feels coercive (trust breaks fast in idle communities).
- Distribution is “random website with no traffic” (no channel leverage).

## Unknowns to validate next

- Does realism meaningfully increase retention vs baseline idle loop?
- Optimal balance of idle vs interactive decisions (AB testable).
- Device performance constraints + graceful degradation strategy.


### PITCH-0002

ID: PITCH-0002
Title: Ant Colony Tutor (ChatGPT Edition)
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies:
Owner:

## One-line pitch

An interactive ant colony simulation inside ChatGPT — part game, part educational tool. You can play, then ask the AI why things happen and get explanations in real time.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0003 (primary), SEG-0002 (secondary niche)
- Target candidate persona(s): CPE-0003 (primary)

## Trigger / why-now

- ChatGPT Apps is new; early adopters are exploring beyond productivity.
- “No tab switching” + novelty of a visual sim inside chat makes it easy to try.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Pain: in-chat entertainment is limited; switching context breaks flow.
- Gain: seamless in-chat “play + learn” loop with AI explanations and natural language control.

## “So it works because…” (mechanism hypothesis)

- Use embedded app UI for the sim; use chat for explanation + control.
- When in-chat commerce is available, conversion can be low-friction for premium content.

## Differentiation

- First-mover inside ChatGPT for this category; conversational “tutor” layer is the key delta vs normal idle games.

## Likely objections + counters

- “Games in chat are clunky”: keep UI minimal; let chat handle complexity.
- “Gimmick risk”: ensure the AI layer provides real utility (debugging colony failures, explaining behaviors).

## EvidenceIDs

E-0009, E-0010

## Confidence

C1/C2 — high-upside experiment; market adoption and discovery are unproven.

## “We lose when…”

- Novelty wears off and retention is low.
- Platform discovery/policy doesn’t favor games.
- Performance constraints (mobile/webgpu) make the experience fragile.

## Unknowns to validate next

- Will ChatGPT users actually play games in-chat?
- What interaction model works (buttons vs natural language)?
- Session persistence and UX expectations inside ChatGPT.

### PITCH-0003

ID: PITCH-0003
Title: Sim Colony Builder (Series)
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies:
Owner:

## One-line pitch

Build a reusable WebGPU idle-simulation engine and ship a series of themed “colony builder” sims (Ants, Bees, Termites, etc.) to maximize reuse and get multiple acquisition angles.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0002 (primary), SEG-0001 (theme-dependent secondary)
- Target candidate persona(s): CPE-0002 (primary); theme-driven casual variants (future)

## Trigger / why-now

- If the ant sim works, the core simulation + idle economy can be reused to create multiple “at-bats”.
- Nature/sandbox themes have persistent interest; each theme targets a different niche community.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Player pain: content exhaustion in one sim; desire for new ecosystems.
- Business pain: high cost of new products; gain: reuse tech + shared learnings; cumulative audience for monetization.

## “So it works because…” (mechanism hypothesis)

- Common engine handles agent simulation + idle progression; content packs swap assets/parameters.
- Cross-promotion and shared account/community can increase LTV across titles.

## Differentiation

- Portfolio strategy vs single-title competitors; “known for high-quality nature sims” brand.

## EvidenceIDs

E-0002, E-0011, E-0012

## Confidence

C2 — reuse logic is sound; cross-title demand/cannibalization is uncertain.

## “We lose when…”

- We ship follow-ups that feel copy-pasted or dilute quality.
- Themes cannibalize rather than expand audience.
- Engine doesn’t generalize well across ecosystems without major rework.

## Unknowns to validate next

- Cross-theme interest: what other ecosystems do players want after ants?
- Whether shared accounts/community materially improves retention.
- Operational capacity to deliver multiple titles without quality loss.

## Hypotheses

Title: Ant Colony Idle Game — Hypotheses (segments/personas/pains/gains)
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies: 
Owner: 

## D) Segmentation prioritization logic

Checklist:
- Prioritization logic (scoring or narrative)
- Buying-center dynamics by segment
- Deprioritized segments + rationale
- Explicit out-of-scope segments

Prioritization narrative (web-only hypothesis):
- We prioritize **SEG-0001 (Casual Idle Gamers)** for first-run UX (fast time-to-value, clarity, delight).
- We keep **SEG-0002 (Simulation/Strategy Enthusiasts)** by layering optional depth (realistic behaviors, strategy controls) without gating the casual experience.
- We treat **SEG-0003 (ChatGPT Power-Users / Edutainment Seekers)** as a **distribution + packaging wedge** (not a separate product at first): same core sim, augmented with AI explanation and in-chat invocation.

Buying-center dynamics:
- Primary buyer is the player. For minors, parents act as gatekeepers for IAP (safety + spend controls).
- For SEG-0003, the platform (OpenAI) is a gatekeeper: app review + discovery can dominate early adoption.

Deprioritized / out-of-scope segments:
- Hardcore competitive gamers (PvP/esports): misfit for idle/sim pacing.
- Pure match-3 casual players with no idle/sim interest: not worth concept dilution.
- Institutional educational buyers (district/procurement): B2B licensing is out of scope.
- Crypto/NFT/web3 gamers: out of scope (audience + backlash risk).

## E) Core workflows (3–7)

Checklist:
- 3–7 workflows only (keep sharp)
- Each workflow written as: trigger → steps → outcome
- Identify who performs each step (role tags)
- Identify integration/data prerequisites where relevant

Workflows (hypotheses; distilled from raw):
- **W1: Start new colony (onboarding)**: trigger → start new colony → choose defaults (or species/environment) → guided first forage/hatch → outcome: “I get it” + first win.
- **W2: Idle check-in loop**: trigger → return after hours → offline summary → spend resources on upgrades/expansion → outcome: meaningful progress in <5 minutes (SEG-0001).
- **W3: Challenge event**: trigger → predator/weather event → deploy ants / spend item → outcome: short spike of agency + renewed goals (avoid punitive fail states).
- **W4: Meta-progression (expansion/prestige)**: trigger → milestone reached → unlock new territory / evolve → outcome: refreshed goals + long-term retention.
- **W5: In-chat IAP (ChatGPT variant)**: trigger → intent to buy → in-chat checkout → immediate benefit → outcome: low-friction conversion (E-0010).

## Methods

ID: RA-001
Title: Ant Colony Idle Game — Methods
Status: Draft
Updated: 2026-01-09
Dependencies: 
Owner: 

## C) Research intent + method (web) + source profile + bias notes

Checklist:
- Research intent (what decision(s) this supports)
- Method(s) used (web search, competitive scan, doc triangulation, desk research)
- Source profile (types + counts): docs, blogs, analyst notes, forums, reviews, filings, OSS repos
- Date range and freshness
- Bias notes (selection bias, survivorship, availability)
- Confidence grading approach (how you assigned C1–C3)

Intent:
- Determine whether an ant-colony “pseudo-idle” simulation has credible demand + monetization paths, and whether ChatGPT Apps is a plausible distribution wedge.

Method (web-only):
- Desk research + competitive scan (market products, portals, app stores, Steam)
- Forum/review mining for monetization sentiment and UX failure modes
- Lightweight triangulation: combine at least one “hard” signal (store metrics / published stats) with qualitative signals where possible
- Synthesize into: reference solutions → competitive landscape → pitch set → segment/persona hypotheses

Source profile (representative):
- App store listings + reviews (`play.google.com`)
- Steam pages (`store.steampowered.com`)
- Blogs/industry notes (`xsolla.com`, `blog.founders.illinois.edu`)
- Forums/social (`reddit.com`, `steamcommunity.com`)
- Platform announcements (`openai.com`) and secondary commentary (`medium.com`, `synergylabs.co`)
- OSS/academic demos (`github.com`, `discourse.threejs.org`)

Date range:
- Research assembled January 2026 (see `Updated:` fields). Platform-roadmap items are time-sensitive.

Bias notes:
- Availability bias (English web + discoverable sources)
- Survivorship bias (successful games have more visible metrics)
- Forum selection bias (loud minority; over-index on negative monetization sentiment)

Confidence grading approach:
- C3: triangulated and/or backed by store metrics or multiple aligned sources
- C2: plausible but incomplete; meaningful uncertainty remains
- C1: speculative; requires direct validation/prototype telemetry

## C.1) Research log (queries + source trail)

Checklist:
- Search queries used (and why)
- “Source trail” notes (how you followed references)
- What you deliberately ignored (and why)

| Timestamp | Query / path | What you were testing | Sources opened |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-01-08 | "idle ants downloads" | Is there mass-market demand for ant idle theme? | `play.google.com` |
| 2026-01-08 | "ant colony simulation game steam" | Are there “serious” ant sims and how are they received? | `store.steampowered.com`, `steamcommunity.com` |
| 2026-01-08 | "idle game monetization ads vs iap" | What monetization patterns are standard and what fails? | `xsolla.com`, `blog.founders.illinois.edu`, `reddit.com` |
| 2026-01-08 | "ChatGPT Apps SDK in-app purchases" | Is ChatGPT a plausible new distribution wedge? | `openai.com`, `synergylabs.co`, `medium.com` |
| 2026-01-08 | "GPU ant colony simulation pheromone trails" | Is large-scale ant sim technically plausible in GPU/web contexts? | `github.com`, `discourse.threejs.org` |

## I) Quantification anchors (value ranges)

Checklist:
- Unit of value (time saved, risk reduced, revenue, compliance)
- Measurable vs not measurable
- Time-to-value bands (ranges)
- Any quantified anchors (even rough ranges) + what would firm them up

Unit of value:
- Player value is time/attention + “progress felt” (offline progress, satisfying growth loop).
- Monetization value typically maps to time saved (boosts), content unlocked (species/maps), and cosmetics/support.

Measurable anchors (hypotheses):
- Retention targets (idle baseline): D1 > 40%, D7 > 15%, D30 > 5% (directional; validate by cohort).
- ARPDAU (directional): $0.05–$0.20 (depends on ads vs IAP mix; ChatGPT variant likely IAP-first).

Time-to-value bands:
- <1 minute: visible progress (first forage/hatch).
- <1 hour: meaningful new unlock (new ant type / chamber).
- 1–2 days: milestone (prestige/expansion) to refresh loop.

## J) Alternatives, switching costs, win/lose patterns

Checklist:
- Do-nothing baseline and inertia
- Switching costs (technical, org, procurement)
- Competitor comparisons (if any)
- Explicit “we lose when…” conditions

Do-nothing baseline:
- Players choose other idle games, other entertainment, or (for enthusiasts) premium sims. There is no urgent “pain”, so discovery + novelty must carry acquisition.

Switching costs:
- Low for casual idle (many free alternatives).
- Medium for sim enthusiasts once invested (time spent learning/optimizing + sunk cost).
- Potentially medium for ChatGPT users if it becomes part of their daily routine.

Win/lose patterns (hypotheses):
- We lose if first-session clarity/polish is weaker than mainstream idle.
- We lose if “realism” is only cosmetic (SEG-0002 churn).
- We lose if monetization feels coercive (SEG-0001 churn + bad reviews).
- We lose if distribution is unsolved (web-only without reach) (E-0007).

## K) Messaging ingredients (candidate; usable by `<product-marketing>`)

Checklist:
- Resonant phrases (quotes preferred)
- Taboo words / red-flag claims
- Narrative frames that worked
- Claim constraints (must/must-not)

Resonant frames (hypotheses):
- “Relax and watch your colony thrive” (ties to stress-free idle framing, E-0012).
- “Fair monetization: optional spend, no paywalls” (ties to E-0001).
- “Surprisingly deep: real ant behaviors” (SEG-0002 hook; ties to RS-0002/RS-0005 patterns).

Taboo / red-flag claims:
- “Guaranteed realistic” (too strong for web-only); prefer “inspired by real ant behaviors”.
- Any “loot box” / gambling-adjacent framing.

## L) Prioritized use-case catalog (mapped)

Checklist:
- Use cases mapped to personas + triggers
- Integration/data prerequisites
- Dependencies and constraints per use case

Use cases (initial):
- Casual: start + check-in loop (CPE-0001, trigger = downtime).
- Enthusiast: “run experiments” sandbox mode (CPE-0002, trigger = curiosity/strategy).
- ChatGPT: “ask why” explanations + natural-language controls (CPE-0003, trigger = in-chat novelty).

## M) Capability constraints + non-negotiables

Checklist:
- Latency / performance requirements
- Auditability / compliance requirements
- Data residency / security posture
- Support model expectations (if relevant)

Constraints (hypotheses):
- WebGPU availability/performance variability (notably iOS constraints) must be handled (degrade gracefully).
- Performance target: smooth at small colony; degrade without breaking play at large colony.
- If distributed via ChatGPT: adhere to platform review/policy; avoid unsafe data collection; provide clear privacy notes.

## N) Assumption register + gaps + validation plan

Checklist:
- Assumptions (explicit)
- Research gaps and unknowns
- Validation plan (next experiments)
- “Do not sell here” edge cases (explicit)

Assumptions:
- F2P monetization norms apply; fair/optional monetization matters (E-0001).
- Ant theme has enough top-of-funnel pull (E-0002).

Gaps/unknowns:
- True player retention/engagement with a “realistic” ant sim (prototype required).
- ChatGPT “games” adoption and discoverability (E-0009/E-0010 are directional only).

Validation plan (next):
- Prototype core loop (forage/hatch/upgrade) + one “realism” mechanic (pheromone trails) and test with target communities.
- A/B test onboarding complexity vs retention; test monetization offers for backlash signals.
- Evaluate distribution: web portals vs ChatGPT Apps; measure activation + revisit rate.

“Do not sell here” edge cases:
- Avoid promising scientific accuracy or educational outcomes without validation.
- Avoid competitive PvP or power-selling if later competition is introduced (E-0013).

## Appendix: Glossary + naming table

| Canonical term | Disallowed synonyms | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| pseudo-idle | “AFK-only” | Idle progression with intermittent meaningful decisions. |
| fair monetization | “pay-to-win” | Fair means no hard paywalls; purchases are optional/convenience/cosmetic. |
| WebGPU | “GPU everywhere” | Assume variability; must degrade gracefully. |
