## One-line pitch

Build a reusable WebGPU idle-simulation engine and ship a series of themed “colony builder” sims (Ants, Bees, Termites, etc.) to maximize reuse and get multiple acquisition angles.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0002 (primary), SEG-0001 (theme-dependent secondary)
- Target candidate persona(s): CPE-0002 (primary); theme-driven casual variants (future)

## Trigger / why-now

- If the ant sim works, the core simulation + idle economy can be reused to create multiple “at-bats”.
- Nature/sandbox themes have persistent interest; each theme targets a different niche community.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Player pain: content exhaustion in one sim; desire for new ecosystems.
- Business pain: high cost of new products; gain: reuse tech + shared learnings; cumulative audience for monetization.

## “So it works because…” (mechanism hypothesis)

- Common engine handles agent simulation + idle progression; content packs swap assets/parameters.
- Cross-promotion and shared account/community can increase LTV across titles.

## Differentiation

- Portfolio strategy vs single-title competitors; “known for high-quality nature sims” brand.

## EvidenceIDs

E-0002, E-0011, E-0012

## Confidence

C2 — reuse logic is sound; cross-title demand/cannibalization is uncertain.

## “We lose when…”

- We ship follow-ups that feel copy-pasted or dilute quality.
- Themes cannibalize rather than expand audience.
- Engine doesn’t generalize well across ecosystems without major rework.

## Unknowns to validate next

- Cross-theme interest: what other ecosystems do players want after ants?
- Whether shared accounts/community materially improves retention.
- Operational capacity to deliver multiple titles without quality loss.
