## Snapshot
- SegmentID: SEG-0002
- Role tags: end-user
- Role: simulation/strategy enthusiast
- Context: explores systems; cares about authenticity and agency
- Primary goals:
  - Believable emergent behaviors that reward experimentation
  - Meaningful decisions (not just waiting)
  - Monetization that doesn’t break realism or feel coercive

## Jobs-to-be-done
- Run experiments in a complex system and feel mastery.

## Pain points
- “Idle will be shallow” / reskin fear (P-0006)
- F2P monetization breaking sim integrity (E-0013)
- Web distribution friction / expectations for quality (E-0007)

## Current alternatives
- Premium PC/RTS ant sims (deeper but higher friction)
- Strategy/sim games with strong system depth

## Success looks like
- I can pursue strategies and see real consequences, and I’m willing to pay modestly if it feels fair.

## Promotion notes (to <product-marketing>)
- Intended canonical persona: PER-XXXX (allocate on promotion)
- What must survive the promotion:
  - “Meaningful agency within the idle loop” (E-0005)
  - “Fair monetization that respects the sim” (E-0013)

## Notes / evidence

- Confidence: C2
- Source notes (web-only):
  - Integration of sim growth with upgrade earning (E-0005)
  - Web distribution realism / user expectations (E-0007)
  - Monetization vs competition / legitimacy logic (E-0013)
