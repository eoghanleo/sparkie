## Snapshot
- SegmentID: SEG-0001
- Role tags: end-user
- Role: casual idle gamer
- Context: short downtime sessions; wants low-stress progress
- Primary goals:
  - Relaxing, satisfying progress in <5 minutes
  - Offline progress that feels meaningful
  - Cute/quirky theme without cognitive load

## Jobs-to-be-done
- Fill downtime with a low-friction game that still feels like “I built something”.

## Pain points
- Monetization pressure / whale-bait pricing (E-0001)
- Overwhelm early / pacing stalls later (E-0003)
- Repetition without novelty (see SEG-0001 pains)

## Current alternatives
- Mobile idle titles (e.g., “Idle Ants” genre)
- Simple casual games that don’t require learning a system

## Success looks like
- I can check in, make upgrades, and feel good progress without being forced to pay.

## Promotion notes (to <product-marketing>)
- Intended canonical persona: PER-XXXX (allocate on promotion)
- What must survive the promotion:
  - “Fair optional monetization” as a core promise (E-0001)
  - “Stress-free play” framing (E-0012)

## Notes / evidence
- EvidenceIDs: E-0001, E-0003, E-0012
- Confidence: C2
- Source notes (web-only):
  - Monetization fairness preference + whale milking language (E-0001)
  - Early overwhelm / later slowdown reviews (E-0003)
  - “Relaxing experience” framing for idle games (E-0012)
