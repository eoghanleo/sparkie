## Snapshot
- SegmentID: SEG-0003
- Role tags: end-user
- Role: heavy ChatGPT user / early adopter
- Context: in-chat discovery; values seamlessness and novelty
- Primary goals:
  - Zero context-switching (in-chat launch)
  - “AI adds value” (explain, guide, or enable controls)
  - Low-friction purchase/upgrade paths if trust is high

## Jobs-to-be-done
- Get quick integrated entertainment while staying inside ChatGPT.

## Pain points
- Context switching / friction (E-0009)
- Trust/safety + state persistence concerns (see SEG-0003 pains)
- Gimmick risk if AI doesn’t materially help

## Current alternatives
- Other in-chat apps and lightweight games
- Web games (but they require leaving chat)

## Success looks like
- I can launch, play, and ask “why did that happen?” without leaving the conversation.

## Promotion notes (to <product-marketing>)
- Intended canonical persona: PER-XXXX (allocate on promotion)
- What must survive the promotion:
  - “No tab switching” as a primary UX benefit (E-0009)
  - In-chat purchase feasibility assumptions must be caveated (E-0010)

## Notes / evidence
- EvidenceIDs: E-0009, E-0010
- Confidence: C2
- Source notes (web-only):
  - ChatGPT Apps UI: app appears “in your conversation” (E-0009)
  - Planned in-chat purchase infrastructure (E-0010)
