## B) Competitive landscape + relative competition

Checklist:
- Identify direct/adjacent competitors and category substitutes
- Summarize positioning and differentiation axes
- Capture win/lose patterns (“we lose when…”) as hypotheses
- Note switching costs and inertia drivers

## Competitive landscape table

| Competitor | Category | ICP/segment | Positioning claim | Key strengths | Key weaknesses | “We lose when…” | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idle Ants (Madbox) | Hypercasual idle | SEG-0001 | “Watch ants eat everything” novelty idle. | Ultra-accessible; viral visuals; proven UA scale. | Shallow; ad-heavy patterns; not a “real” sim. | If our onboarding is too heavy or visuals less delightful for a 5-minute try. | `play.google.com` |
| Idle Ant Colony (Bling) | Mid-core idle tycoon | SEG-0001/SEG-0002 | “Build an ant empire across the world” w/ research + maps. | Multi-track progression; active updates/community; moderate goodwill. | Pacing/grind complaints; onboarding overload; mobile-centric. | If our sim depth doesn’t translate into clear goals/progression (they retain better). | `play.google.com` |
| Empires of the Undergrowth | Premium PC ant RTS/sim | SEG-0002 | Realistic ant species + missions on PC. | Depth; production value; established community. | Paid barrier; time/complexity; not idle. | If our “realism” is superficial or we lack credibility with sim enthusiasts. | `store.steampowered.com` |
| Swarm Simulator: Evolution | Incremental on Steam | SEG-0001/SEG-0002 | Deep incremental progression with “swarm” theme. | Proven long-tail idle systems; prestige mastery. | Monetization/QoL backlash risk; complexity onboarding. | If our idle economy is too thin (no long-term systems), they win on retention depth. | `store.steampowered.com` |
| Mainstream idle tycoons (Idle Miner Tycoon, Egg, Inc.) | Mainstream idle economy | SEG-0001 | “Manage X and get rich” refined idle loops. | Highly optimized retention + monetization; polish. | Generic themes; low educational/sim novelty. | If we fail to match basic polish/clarity in the first session. | `blog.founders.illinois.edu` |
| ChatGPT app ecosystem (early apps) | Distribution channel substitute | SEG-0003 | “Don’t switch tabs; run apps in chat.” | Huge installed base; conversational invocation; planned in-chat checkout. | Discovery unproven; policy/review gates; webgpu constraints. | If ChatGPT users don’t adopt games in-chat, or we rely solely on this channel. | `openai.com` |
