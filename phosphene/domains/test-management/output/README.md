# Test Management (Domain)

Primary artifacts:
- `test-plan` — what to test, how to test it, and coverage expectations.

Canonical locations:
- Working artifacts: `phosphene/domains/test-management/output/test-plans/`

Handoff (default):
- **From Scrum Management** when scope is stable enough to plan tests.
- **To Retrospective** when outcomes are known (pass/fail + learnings).
